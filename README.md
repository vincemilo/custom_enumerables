# custom_enumerables
A mini project for The Odin project's Full Stack Ruby On Rails path Ruby Programming section where we have to rebuild several enumerable methods to get used to using yield and call. The enumerable methods that need to be rebuild and the result of the rebuild are:

    each : my_each
    each_with_index : my_each_with_index
    select : my_select
    all? : my_all?
    any? : my_any?
    none? : my_none?
    count : my_count
    map : my_map (also modified to take a proc)
    inject : my_inject
